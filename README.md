Project Description:
  A multiplayer game that is similar to Text Twist. In this game, players race to unscramble 6 to 7 letter words in order to gain points. Points are given based factors such as speed of submission and length of the correctly submitted words. A round consists of a scrambled 6 to 7 letter word; each round lasts until the timer runs out, or once one of the players correctly submits the full word. One game of Letter Linx may span between 10-20 rounds.

  Goal: To accumulate the highest score among all the players by quickly and correctlysubmitting words/sub-words given a set of scrambled letters.
